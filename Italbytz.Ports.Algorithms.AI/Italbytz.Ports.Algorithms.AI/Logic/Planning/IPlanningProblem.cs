/// <summary>
/// A set of action schemas serves as a definition of a planning domain. A 
/// specific problem within the domain is defined with the addition of an 
/// initial state and a goal. The initial state is a conjunction of ground 
/// atoms.
/// The goal is just like a precondition: a conjunction of literals 
/// (positive or negative) that may contain variables, such as 
/// At(p, SFO) âˆ§ Plane(p). Any variables are treated as existentially 
/// quantified, so this goal is to have any plane at SFO. The problem is solved 
/// when we can find a sequence of actions that end in a state s that entails 
/// the goal.
