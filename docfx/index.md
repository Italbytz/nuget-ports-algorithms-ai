# About

This package ([Source Code](https://github.com/Italbytz/nuget-ports-algorithms-ai)) mainly provides ``Interfaces`` for the algorithms discussed in [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu). Most of the code is based on code from the official [AIMA repositories](https://github.com/aimacode). It follows the [Hexagonal Architecture](https://web.archive.org/web/20180822100852/http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture) in providing ports. Example implementations may be found in [Italbytz.Adapters.Algorithms](https://github.com/Italbytz/nuget-adapters-algorithms).   

More documentation may be found with the [Source Code](https://github.com/Italbytz/nuget-ports-algorithms-ai).
